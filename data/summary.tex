I am bioinformatician with a passion for building tools for reproducible research and data analysis pipelines. In my most recent role, I joined a small team as the lone bioinfomatician to build the infrastructure and pipelines to process and analyze what is likely the largest set of environmental metagenomic data in the world. Through this endeavor I have gained a lot of experience as a full-stack bioinfomatician, and continue to try to foster my desire to learn by continuing to take on new challenges every day. I hope to find a position where I can use my experience and expertise in genomic and metagenomic analyses to continue to have the opportunity to engage in meaningful research in a team with great scientists.
